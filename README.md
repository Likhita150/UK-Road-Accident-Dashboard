# UK-Road-Accident-Dashboard
Utilizing Power BI, I enhanced data exploration and decision-making through clear and concise bar chart visualizations of accident data across various dimensions. Stakeholders can now implement evidence-based road safety interventions and policies more effectively. I incorporated interactive slicers for filtering by district and accident severity, facilitating targeted analysis. Additionally, a line chart was employed to analyze daily accident counts, while a pie chart visualized accidents investigated by police force. Further, a scatter chart was utilized to analyze average casualties based on the number of vehicles involved. This approach provides stakeholders with actionable insights for improving road safety measures.
